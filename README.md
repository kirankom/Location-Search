# Location Search
### Data Generation
    Grab your data from Google Maps. Multiply/replicate the data so it reflects the data of say 1000 users
    1000 users * 1000 location events per user per day = 1 million data points

### Storing Data
    Store the data in Polygons Look into Bitmaps and Roaring Bitmaps

### Compression
    Use Roaring Bitmaps to compress the Polygon of data and then store it in vector form. The compressed data should be as close to real    
    life as possible

### Timeline: 
    Due in 8 - 12 Weeks (around July 20th - August 17th)
    Want to be done in 6 weeks (week of July 6th)
